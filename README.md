> **"The truth is just a file someone forgot to delete."** — Luc Vernier

Welcome to the **HeroTerminal World** repository.

This is the canonical database for the [HeroTerminal.com](https://heroterminal.com) universe. It contains the narrative assets, investigator profiles, and case files that power the HeroOS simulation engine.

**This is the "Universe" data, not the application code.**

## ✍️ Contributing

We invite the community to expand this universe. You can write new cases for existing investigators or create your own characters.

**Before you start, read the rules.**

> “If you can read logs and follow a trail, I do not care what music you listen to or what coat you wear.
>
> But if you send me a clown in sunglasses hacking satellites with a shimmering keyboard, I will reject you so fast the timestamp won’t even register.”
