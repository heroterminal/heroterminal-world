# Manual of Aromatic Indices (Pocket Sheet)

Refractive index (n20/D) tells you if the sample bends light like the real plant oils.

- Natural Rose Absolute: **1.510**
- Synthetic Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol: **1.490**

Usage: align the blue/white split line in the refractometer eyepiece; the number at the intersection is the index.
