Luc,

We need to talk about branding.

Your forensics tool is brilliant. But the name "Lens"? It may sound elegant to you, but to the market, it sounds like a birdwatching app or a dishwasher brand. It doesn't scream "enterprise-grade security." Good tool, terrible packaging.

So I made some executive decisions to ensure we actually survive.

First, I purchased the domain: heroterminal.com

Second, we are launching a network. The HeroTerminal Network (HTN) launches next month. This is the platform where clients will hire us and where we will deploy cases.

Third, and listen before you react: I intend to package your tool as the core operating system of this network. We should call it "HeroOS".

Before you get angry: companies already responded to the concept. The Swiss consortium likes the "Hero" branding. It sells trust. So does the insurance group in Paris and the fintech client in Geneva. (Yes, I took the liberty of showing them the prototype under the new branding.)

This is bigger than Lyon now. You cannot handle all cases alone. People trust you, Luc, but you do not scale. We need a real network.

Let the community handle the small cases through the platform. You take the ones that actually matter using the tool.

I created your official address: lvernier@heroterminal.com Passwords in a separate email. Please change them. Don't use the ones you always use. I know them by heart.

Try to see the opportunity here. This isn’t "selling out". It's scaling up.

— Claire
