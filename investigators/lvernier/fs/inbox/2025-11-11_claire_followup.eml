Subject: HTN: Immediate Response After Rebrand (Action Required)

Luc,

Two days. That’s how long it took after announcing the HeroTerminal Network.

The Swiss banking consortium replied this morning. They want a demo for their fraud division. The Paris insurance group asked for a quote.

The branding works.

Julien confirms he sent over the final paperwork based on our agreement last night. Sign it.

As discussed, the "HeroOS" concept is dead. You wrote the code, you keep the name. I have already updated the client-facing decks to reflect that "Lens" is the exclusive forensic interface powered by HTN.

However, as I told you, this is a two-way street. We need marketable assets for the community. Therefore, the validation protocols and completion badges will remain branded as "HeroCerts".

I know you think it sounds like a breakfast cereal. I don’t care. The market metrics indicate that clients value transferable credentials. You ensure Lens is technically flawless; let me ensure the network is financially viable for Élise's sake.

We need to move. HTN must launch with at least three verified investigator profiles ready for the Swiss demo.

Reality is knocking, Luc. Answer the door.

— Claire

P.S. Your old Lens documentation site is still live. Kill it before a client sees it.
P.P.S. Change your voicemail. It still just says “don’t call”. It’s unsettling.
