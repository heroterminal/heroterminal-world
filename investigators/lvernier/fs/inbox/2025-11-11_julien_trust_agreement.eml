Subject: LEGAL: IP Licensing & The "Élise" Structure (CONFIDENTIAL)

Luc,

Claire tells me you finally saw reason after your little explosion yesterday regarding the rebranding. Good.

Attached is the final executable framework for the deal you hammered out with her late last night. Read it carefully, though I doubt you’ll understand the finer points of corporate law.

Here is the summary of the structure I have built:

**1. The IP License:**
You grant HeroTerminal Network (HTN) perpetual, exclusive, worldwide licensing rights to the "Lens" source code and architecture. You remain the nominal author, but HTN controls commercial deployment.

**2. Your Compensation (Refused):**
As noted, you have explicitly refused personal equity or stock options in HTN. A foolish financial decision, but very on-brand for you.

**3. The "Élise V." Irrevocable Trust:**
In lieu of paying you, HTN will deposit a founder-level equity stake (Class B Non-Voting Shares) into a private trust fund.
- Beneficiary: Élise Marie Vernier.
- Vesting: The trust unlocks fully upon her 25th birthday.
- Trustee: Delacroix Partners until vesting date.

It’s a solid legal structure, Luc. Ironclad. It is completely shielded from any financial liability you might incur in your... "fieldwork."

Sign the attached PDF (pages 4, 12, and 35) immediately. We need this filed before the Swiss demo.

Consider the debt from November '23 (the Galeries Lafayette incident) paid in full. You have secured her future using the only asset you have.

Try not to screw it up for her.

- Julien
