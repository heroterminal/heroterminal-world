VEHICLE: Peugeot 406 (1999)
COLOR: Gris Thallium
ENGINE: 2.0 HDi (Bulletproof)

MAINTENANCE LOG:
- Jan: Oil change. Mechanic tried to buy it. I said no.
- Mar: Exhaust rattling. Fixed with wire.
- Jun: AC failed. I prefer the windows down anyway.
- Oct: Strange noise at 110km/h. It sounds like the fuel pump.
       Or maybe the ghosts are rattling the chains.

NEXT SERVICE:
Check the suspension.
