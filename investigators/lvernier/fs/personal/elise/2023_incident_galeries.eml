Luc,

It is done.

I spoke with the District Prosecutor this morning. We played golf.
The shoplifting charge at Galeries Lafayette has been dropped.
The "other items" found in her bag (the pills) were not entered into evidence.
Technically, the arrest never happened. The record is clean.

However, this cost me significant political capital. You owe me.

Don't lecture her, Luc. She's a teenager acting out because her father
insists on living in the previous century.

Claire is taking her to our chalet in Chamonix for a week to cool off.
